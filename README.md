### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am Hisbi Asyihristani Rijal, an economics student at Universitas Padjadjaran. I have an interest in understanding data, making analysis based on data, and also visualizing data. 

I am currently participating in Bangkit Academy by following the machine learning path. Until now I have been able to do research using Excel, [Stata software](https://github.com/artsyhrstn/econometrics-tutorial), [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hisbi.asyihristani1234/vizzes) and also using the Python programming language. My desire to excel motivates me to actively seek opportunities that can enhance my personal development achievements and advance my career in data science.
